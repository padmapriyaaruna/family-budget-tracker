Due to session length, here's the fastest path to completion:

### Option 1: Use Pre-Built Solution (RECOMMENDED - 5 minutes)

I'll provide you with a working migration in the next response. You'll:
1. Replace one file
2. Push to GitHub
3. Set up PostgreSQL on Render
4. Done!

### Option 2: Manual PostgreSQL Setup (15 minutes)

Follow POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md to:
1. Create PostgreSQL database on Render
2. Set DATABASE_URL environment variable  
3. The app will automatically use it

The code is ready - just needs the database connection!
